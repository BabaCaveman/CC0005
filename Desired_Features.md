Here are essential UI design components for a video learning system targeting technologically illiterate users:

**Navigation & Layout:**
- Extremely simple, single-column layout with minimal menu options
- Large, clearly labeled buttons with descriptive text (not just icons)
- Breadcrumb navigation showing exactly where they are in the course
- Consistent placement of elements across all pages

**Video Player Controls:**
- Oversized play/pause button with clear visual feedback
- Simple volume control with visual indicators
- Progress bar that clearly shows current position and remaining time
- Speed control limited to just "Normal" and "Slower" options
- Automatic subtitles/captions turned on by default

**Content Organization:**
- Linear progression through lessons (no complex branching)
- Clear lesson numbering and titles
- Visual progress indicators showing completion status
- "Next Lesson" and "Previous Lesson" buttons prominently displayed

**User Support Features:**
- Always-visible help button leading to simple, visual instructions
- Phone number or live chat prominently displayed
- "I'm stuck" or "Need help" button on every page
- Simple restart/reset options if users get confused

**Accessibility & Clarity:**
- Large, high-contrast text (minimum 16px font size)
- Generous white space to avoid visual clutter
- Error messages in plain language with clear next steps
- Confirmation dialogs for any destructive actions
- Option to increase text size throughout the site

**Technical Considerations:**
- Fast loading times with minimal bandwidth requirements
- Works reliably on older browsers and devices
- Minimal required account setup with password recovery options
- Automatic saving of progress without user action needed

The key is prioritizing simplicity and predictability over advanced features, ensuring users never feel lost or overwhelmed.
